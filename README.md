## Overview

Localize is an interactive, web-based platform designed to help international students familiarize themselves with their new host countries. Through a series of engaging scenarios and dialog-based interactions, students learn to navigate daily life in a new cultural and linguistic environment. This application aims to ease the transition for students studying abroad and enhance their understanding of the local customs, language, and essential day-to-day activities.
